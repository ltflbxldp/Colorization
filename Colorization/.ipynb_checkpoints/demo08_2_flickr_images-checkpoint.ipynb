    "For many image processing problems, one needs to create a dataset of images of particular classes.  The [ImageNet site](http://www.image-net.org/) has an enormous set of images of 1000 different classes with bounding boxes.  But, this set may not have the exact image classes you are looking for.  An alternative simple way to generate image datasets is via the [Flickr API](https://stuvel.eu/flickrapi-doc/), which gives you access to millions of images in the Flickr database.\n",
